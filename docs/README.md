# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This collection of guides and best practices provides a comprehensive framework for delivering customer-focused projects through structured, iterative processes. Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for specific guidance, this documentation serves as your central reference for how we run projects at OctoAcme.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a five-phase project lifecycle designed to ensure successful delivery: **Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective**. During Initiation, we validate business needs through a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline. The Planning phase establishes detailed scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies, while creating a roadmap and backlog that guides development. Throughout Execution, teams follow an iterative build-test-review cycle, leveraging GitHub Projects for tracking and maintaining small, focused pull requests with clear acceptance criteria and comprehensive quality assurance.

Our workflows emphasize collaboration and quality at every step. Projects begin with stakeholder alignment and continue through structured backlog management using project boards with clearly defined columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done). The pull request process enforces code quality through automated testing, security scanning, and peer reviews before merging. Quality assurance practices include unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA when needed. Continuous integration pipelines ensure code meets standards before deployment, while success metrics defined in the Project One-pager guide data-informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

Team rhythm and communication are fundamental to our project success. The core team includes a Project Manager (PM) who coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; a Product Manager (PdM) who defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog; and Developers who implement features collaboratively. Teams maintain a regular cadence with daily standups, weekly delivery syncs between PM and PdM, twice-weekly team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and regular demos at the end of each sprint or milestone. This consistent communication pattern ensures transparency, rapid issue resolution, and alignment across all stakeholders.

OctoAcme's approach prioritizes customer value through clear ownership, psychological safety, and continuous improvement. We manage risks proactively using a Risk Register that tracks impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and status, with escalation paths from team-level triage through PM and Product Lead to sponsor-level involvement for business-impacting issues. Every project concludes with a retrospective to capture learnings and action items, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This customer-first methodology, combined with iterative delivery, data-informed decisions, and documented processes, enables teams to deliver reliable, high-quality solutions that meet business and user needs.
